      \begin{cvitems}
      \item Launched machine learning model for related questions ranking that \textbf{increased signups by 5.5\%}
      \item Ran and evaluated multiple experiments that tested online performance of related questions ranking models
      \item Built pipeline for training above models (logistic regression, gradient boosted decision trees, random forests) and evaluating them using AUROC and NDCG; decreased training time from 3 hours to 5 minutes by parallelizing feature extraction
      \item Refactored caching layer for related questions resulting in \textbf{90\% less lines of code} and removal of a deprecated caching abstraction
      \item Used Spark to train a collaborative filtering model (ALS matrix factorization) on a matrix with hundreds of millions of items

      \item Individually built three platform services responsible for centralized billing and cross data center transactions using Python/Tornado
      \item Architected payment transactions services to scale to \textbf{millions of users globally} and to replicate data across multiple data centers
      \item Migrated payment account metadata from PostgreSQL to Schemaless (Uber's scalable datastore); sharded data and built indexes to \textbf{allow for constant time queries}
      \item Employed MVCS design paradigm and polymorphism to support quick implementation of additional payment methods
      \item Used Thrift to create language agnostic service interfaces and to maintain a scalable codebase in Uber's service-oriented architecture
